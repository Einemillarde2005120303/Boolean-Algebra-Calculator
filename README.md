# Boolean Algebra Laws

| **Law**                  | **OR Form**                          | **AND Form**                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **1. Identity Law**     | `P + 0 = P`                          | `P ⋅ 1 = P`                           |
| **2. Idempotent Law**   | `P + P = P`                          | `P ⋅ P = P`                           |
| **3. Commutative Law**   | `P + Q = Q + P`                      | `P ⋅ Q = Q ⋅ P`                       |
| **4. Associative Law**  | `P + (Q + R) = (P + Q) + R`         | `P ⋅ (Q ⋅ R) = (P ⋅ Q) ⋅ R`          |
| **5. Distributive Law** | `P + (Q ⋅ R) = (P + Q) ⋅ (P + R)`   | `P ⋅ (Q + R) = (P ⋅ Q) + (P ⋅ R)`    |
| **6. Inversion Law**    | `(A')' = A`                          | `(A')' = A`                           |
| **7. De Morgan's Law**  | `(P + Q)' = P' ⋅ Q'`                | `(P ⋅ Q)' = P' + Q'`                 |
| **8. Complement Law**   | `P + P' = 1`                         | `P ⋅ P' = 0`                          |
| **9. Domination Law**   | `P + 1 = 1`                         | `P ⋅ 0 = 0`                          |
| **10. Double Negation Law** | `(P')' = P`                     | `(P')' = P`                           |
| **11. Absorption Law**  | `P + (P ⋅ Q) = P`                   | `P ⋅ (P + Q) = P`                     |
