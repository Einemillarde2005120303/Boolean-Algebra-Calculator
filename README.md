# Boolean Algebra Laws

| **Law** | **OR Form** | **AND Form** |
|--|--|--|
| **Identity Law** | `P + 0 = P` | `P ⋅ 1 = P` |
| **Idempotent Law** | `P + P = P` | `P ⋅ P = P` |
| **Commutative Law** | `P + Q = Q + P` | `P ⋅ Q = Q ⋅ P` |
| **Associative Law** | `P + (Q + R) = (P + Q) + R` | `P ⋅ (Q ⋅ R) = (P ⋅ Q) ⋅ R` |
| **Distributive Law** | `P + (Q ⋅ R) = (P + Q) ⋅ (P + R)` | `P ⋅ (Q + R) = (P ⋅ Q) + (P ⋅ R)` |
| **Inversion Law** | `(A')' = A` | `(A')' = A` |
| **De Morgan's Law** | `(P + Q)' = P' ⋅ Q'` | `(P ⋅ Q)' = P' + Q'` |
| **Complement Law** | `P + P' = 1` | `P ⋅ P' = 0` |
| **Domination Law** | `P + 1 = 1` | `P ⋅ 0 = 0` |
| **Double Negation Law** | `(P')' = P` | `(P')' = P` |
| **Absorption Law** | `P + (P ⋅ Q) = P` | `P ⋅ (P + Q) = P` |
